                        <p>In general, I’m not a big fan of random ideas. Ideas are cheap, because everyone 
                        has them. Getting shit done is what counts in the end. But still, there 
                        is something magical about a great idea. We have to understand that ideas are 
                        by nature very fragile. They’re like little naked babies, unable 
                        to protect themselves.</p>

                        <p>If we really believe in a new idea, we have to protect her with great effort. 
                        This is difficult, because oftentimes the greatest ideas get killed by the people 
                        around us. Executing on a great idea is by nature a lonely path. If everyone would 
                        agree with you, the idea is probably not that great anyway.</p>
